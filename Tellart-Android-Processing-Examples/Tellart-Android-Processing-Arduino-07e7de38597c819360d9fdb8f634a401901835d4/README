Android+Processing+Arduino, APA is a collection of examples made by us at Tellart for a workshop we hosted for
the interaction design students at Umea University with the topic Mobile hacking. 

The examples all have individual Processing codes, Arduino codes and illustrations of how to connect up the electronics
and can be found in the download section here at Git

The examples available are:
  * Ball Move  is moving a circle left and right over the screen
  * Move Object is moving a circle over the screen depending on the values from two analog sensors connected to Arduino
  * Color Picker  controls the background color of your Android device using three analog sensors connected to the Arduino
  * Etch a Sketch  is the classic etch a sketch toy in Android style controlled by two analog sensors at the Arduino
  * LED Fade is fading a LED connected to the Arduino by swipping the finger over the screen
  * Oscillo is a analog oscilloscope that draws the value from a analog sensor to the screen visualizing it over time
  * RFID is controlling the background color of the Android device using a set of RFID tags read by the Arduino
  * RGB controls the background color of your Android device using three analog sensors connected to the Arduino
  * RGB Accel is controlling a RGB LED connected to the Arduino using the built in accelerometer at the Android device
  * RGB slider is controlling a RGB LED connected to the Arduino using three sliders at the Android device screen
  * Servo Finger is controlling a servo motor connected to the Arduino by sliding your finger over the screen
  * Servo Slider is controlling a servo motor connected to the Arduino by moving a slider back and forth on the screen
  * TapOn is turning on a LED when you press down at the Android screen
  * Two Led Fade is fading two LEDs by moving your finger around on the screen. X axis is one LED and Y axis the other
